                        kerb crawling, owning or managing a brothel, prostitution in a hotel,child prostitution, pimping and pandering are illegal.There are, 
                        however, many brothels illegally operating in Indian cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai.UNAIDS estimate there were 
                        657,829 prostitutes in the country in 2016. Government organisations like MDACS (Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society) have played 
                        a very prominent role in generating awareness on HIV/AIDS through the assistance in providing free literature and organising street campaigns. 
                        There are several NGO that feed on funds for protecting STI/STDs spread to common population NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation), 
                        a government agency lead these NGOs.The law is vague on prostitution  itself.The primary law dealing with the status of sex workers is 
                        the 1956 law referred to as The Immoral Traffic (Suppression) Act (SITA). According to this law, prostitutes can practise their trade 
                        privately but cannot legally solicit customers in public.A BBC article, however, mentions that prostitution is illegal in India; the 
                        Indian law does not refer to the practice of selling one's own sexual service as "prostitution".Clients can be punished for sexual 
                        activity in proximity to a public place. Organised prostitution (brothels, prostitution rings, pimping, etc.) is illegal. As long as it 
                        is done individually and voluntarily, a woman (male prostitution is not recognised in any law in India) can use her body in exchange for 
                        material benefit. In particular, the law forbids a sex worker to carry on her profession within 200 yards of a public place. Unlike as is 
                        the case with other professions, sex workers are not protected under normal labour laws, but they possess the right to rescue and 
                        rehabilitation if they desire, and they possess all the rights of other citizens.Over the years, India has seen a growing mandate to 
                        legalise prostitution, to avoid exploitation of sex workers and their children by middlemen and in the wake of a growing HIV/AIDS menace.</b>

                        on 19 March 2013, and by the Rajya Sabha on 21 March 2013, which provides for amendment of Indian Penal Code, Indian Evidence Act, and 
                        Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on laws related to sexual offences.The Bill received Presidential assent on 2 April 2013 and was deemed 
                        to be effective from 3 February 2013. It was originally an Ordinance promulgated by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee, on 
                        3 February 2013, in light of the protests in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case.The law has been severely criticized for being gender 
                        biased and giving women the legal authority to commit exactly the same crimes (against which they seek protection) against men with 
                        impunity. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 has been strongly criticised by several human rights and women's rights 
                        organisations for not including certain suggestions recommended by the Verma Committee Report like, marital rape, reduction of age of 
                        consent[failed verification], amending Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act so that no sanction is needed for prosecuting an armed force 
                        personnel accused of a crime against woman.The Government of India, replied that it has not rejected the suggestions fully, but changes 
                        can be made after proper discussion.</b></p>
